+Code the following app
+```
+Title: DCA Planner Lite
+
+Description:
+Create a simple app that helps users plan their Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy. The app should work entirely offline and must not use the internet or external APIs. All data is manually entered by the user.
+
+Functionality:
+ • Display three input fields:
+ 1. “Token Name”
+ 2. “Investment Amount per Period”
+ 3. “Number of Periods”
+ • Add a button labeled “Add Plan”. When clicked, the app calculates:
+ • Total Investment = Investment Amount × Number of Periods
+ • Show the results in a section titled “Your DCA Plans”, where each entry includes:
+ • Token Name
+ • Investment Amount per Period
+ • Number of Periods
+ • Total Investment
+ • Each plan should have a “Delete” button allowing the user to remove that specific entry.
+ • Add a “Clear All” button to remove all DCA plans.
+ • If any required field is empty or invalid, show a message:
+“Please fill in all fields with valid numbers.”
+
+UI Requirements:
+ • Use simple UI: text fields, labels, buttons, and a list.
+ • Keep the layout clean and easy to understand.
+ • All calculations and updates must happen locally inside the app.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
